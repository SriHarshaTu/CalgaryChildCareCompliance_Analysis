# Calgary Childcare Compliance Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis used for exploring compliance trends in Calgary's childcare programs and we have published the medium article based on our analysis: [Unlocking Patterns in Calgary Child Care Program Compliance: An Analytical Approach](https://medium.com/@venkatesh.balusoundar/unlocking-patterns-in-calgary-child-care-program-compliance-an-analytical-approach-ad66ad6dc0b7).

## üìñ Project Overview
Childcare programs play a crucial role in early childhood development, and ensuring regulatory compliance is essential. This analysis investigates patterns in compliance violations across Calgary‚Äôs childcare facilities using data-driven techniques.

### Key Objectives:
- Explore Calgary‚Äôs childcare compliance data.
- Identify trends in regulatory violations.
- Provide insights for improving childcare program standards.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- `Calgary_ChildCare_Compliance_Analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.
- `data/` - Raw and processed datasets used for analysis.
- `images/` - Visualizations generated from the analysis.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation
To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CalgaryChildcareCompliance_Analysis.git   
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Calgary_ChildCare_Compliance_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## üß∞ Methodologies Used
This analysis follows a structured approach:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, standardizing formats.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and insights through visualizations.
3. **Compliance Violations Analysis**: Finding patterns in frequent violations.
4. **Visualization & Reporting**: Using charts to communicate key insights effectively.

## üìö Key Libraries Used
- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib` - Data visualization
- `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization
- `numpy` - Numerical computing

## üîç Insights from the Analysis
- Certain types of violations occur more frequently than others.
- Licensing and regulatory requirements impact compliance trends.
- Data visualization helps pinpoint high-risk areas for non-compliance.
